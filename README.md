# Ray Tracer - Animation Engine
This is my ray tracer project. I have split it up into sub-projects that each aim to accomplish a specific goal and build off of the previous sub-project. The output for each project is a bitmap file which are all displayed below. At the moment, all the sub-projects are built with Visual Studio 2017 using the latest C++ standard and have no dependencies.
