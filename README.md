# Ray Tracer - Animation Engine
I want to make a ray tracer. It sounds fun and the concept seems pretty easy and straightforward. You create a virtual “scene” behind your computer screen. Then, for each pixel on your screen, you shoot a ray into the scene (a ray is just a line with a starting point and a direction).  The ray collides and reflects with the various objects in the scene and tracks color and lighting data which all contributed to the final color of the pixel. It can be a very accurate, not to mention computationally expensive way of rendering a realistic scene.  I’m going to make one.
